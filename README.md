# NeighborHood Map Assignment
The project done as part of Udacity Frontend course assignment lets you browser through a few shopping places in Noida, India. You can filter on these places using the Filter. The filter matches the name starting from index 0 i.e. 'Dec' will match the "Decathlon' but 'thlon' wil not match Decathlon.

The project pulls information about the shopping places using FourSquare API and displays that in an infowindow when one clicks on the marker.
